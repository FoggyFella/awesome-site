    <h1>Good day</h1>

    <p>The day started with the idea that I would just go in town to return the books I had taken from the library. After doing so I decided to stick around for a little bit more and went around town. One of the shops had placed a Pick n Mix stand where you could get any candy you want, I thought that was really cool. y the time I was getting ready and waiting for the bus back home the sun finally got out of the clouds and gave everything a nice warm tone.</p>
    
    <h1>Better day</h1>

    <p>I remembered that earlier my mom called me and said to look for bowties (she was gonna help on a party and wanted to look professional). I was short on time when I remembered this, so I got into the first shop that I thought would have something like that. It was a knitwear shop.</p>
    <p>The owner approached me from the back and asked how he can help. I asked if perchance he has bowties, he answered -and this is a direct quote- "If you came by in 1965, I would have a bowtie for you, but I will still look in the back". And so he brought out this dusty box with a great black velvet bowtie inside it, it looked perfect. I asked how much he would want for it and he said that I can have it, <b>for free</b>. I was flabbergasted by this, and he gave me a pat on the back.</p>

    <p><b>Today was a good day</b></p>

    <h1>PS</h1>

    <p>This is kind of a serious blog post and stuff, im just testing this out. Still not sure if I want to have this irl stuff here.</p>
