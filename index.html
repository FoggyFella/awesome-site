        <p>My name is Alex, but I go by <em>FoggyDude</em> on the internets :D</p>
        <p class="rightAlign"> I am a Ukrainian game developer but I also do other programming stuff... <b><mini>like this site</mini></b></p>
        <p>I have been dabbling in programming and game devving as a hobby since 2022. It all started because I was bored one day.</p>
        <p class="rightAlign">Check out my <a href="pages/socials/socials.html">socials</a> if you wanna!</p>

        <h2 class="anotherOne">< My Games ></h2>
        <p>I first started making games with Python and then moved to Godot Engine. Ever since then I've been mainly using Godot.</p>
        <p class="rightAlign">Game development lets me make my weird ideas playable and I love it. Most of my projects are solo and I enjoy sharing them with the world!</p>
