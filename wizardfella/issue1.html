    <section>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the first issue of the monthly Wizard Fella Islands newsletter!!!</p>
        <p>The idea with this is that I will release monthly posts detailing what I worked on and what I will work on next in the game.</p>
    </section>

    <h1 class="rotatedText2">BIG DREAMS</h1>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>Big Dreams is the first island in the game and also acts as a tutorial. Guided by the Star Messenger you will learn the movement of the game. This month I worked on the first part by making the level and writing the tutorial dialogue.</p>
    </section>

    <p class="smalltext">Image of Big Dreams</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            As you can see from the image it is still in the stage where everything is a gray box. However it's almost finished, with only the final part missing.
            I hope I can finish it fully by next month and actually make it look good. 
            Before that I would also like to get some people to playtest it so I can know whether the layout is good or not.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h1 class="rotatedText">THINGY FOUND</h1>
        <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            The thingies are random collectable items you will find at the end of every island. This is something that would've been a big part of the original Wizard Fella, so I decided to bring them back.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/Thingies.png" alt="Image of picking up the Star Wand" class="borderimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Image of picking up the Star Wand</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            So far there is no save system and no way to view what thingies you have which is why I want to work on the diary next month.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/diaryconcept.png" alt="Idea for how the diary could look like" class="noborderimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Idea for how the diary could look like</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            The diary will serve as the options menu but also like a way for you to view your progress. 
            It is also another thing that I decided to bring over from the old game. 
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <h1 class="rotatedText2">CANNONS</h1>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            Cannons are a new prop that can be used to travel long distances in a cool way. 
            If you jump into it you can rotate it using A/D keys and then charge using the Space key.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/cannongif.gif" alt="GIF of showing off the cannon" class="borderimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Cannons in action</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            Oh and you have to be careful not to hit your head when using the cannons.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h1 class="rotatedText">MARBLE BLOCKS</h1>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            Marble Blocks are props that I intend to use a lot in the game because they look cool, so this month I worked on adding more features to them. 
            They now have options for being falling and being breakable. 
        </p>
    </section>
    <p></p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            If it's set to falling, then it will fall after you stand on it for a few seconds.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/fall.gif" alt="GIF of Marble blocks falling" class="borderimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Marble blocks falling</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            If it's set to breakable, then it will break apart into pieces if you smash into it with a pound.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/break.gif" alt="GIF of Marble blocks breaking" class="borderimg"></p>

    <h1 class="rotatedText2">MINOR CHANGES</h1>

    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            <b>Dialogue</b><br><br>
            I worked on adding BBCode to the dialogue, which basically means I can give some parts of the text a cool effect.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/BBCode.png" alt="image of color BBCode Effect" class="verticalimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">BBCode Color Effect</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            So far I only have a color effect as there are still problems I haven't found a solution for.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p></p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            I also added an interruption counter which NPCs can use to tell if you're interrupting them by skipping through the dialogue. 
            This was mostly added for the Star Messenger in the tutorial but I'm sure I will find some other uses for it. 
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/Annoyed.png" alt="image of annoyed Star Messenger" class="verticalimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Annoyed Star Messenger</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>If you really want, you can make the Star Messenger shut up by interrupting it like 5 times.</p>
    </section>
    <p></p>

    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            <b>ATTACKS</b><br><br>
            You can do three attacks in the game by clicking the left mouse button rapidly. Two are punches and the last is a ranged star attack. The star attack used to shoot farther based on how fast you were moving when you clicked but I changed that.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p><img src="assets/issue1/starcharge.gif" alt="GIF of Charging the star attack" class="borderimg"></p>
    <p class="smalltext">Charging the star attack</p>
    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>Now after two clicks, if you hold the left mouse button you can charge up the star attack.</p>
    </section>
    <p></p>

    <section class="leftalign">
        <p>
            <b>PLAYER TRIGGERS</b><br><br>
            Player trigger is a new node that will do a certain event after a certain trigger from the player. 
            For example if the player does a Pound or Jumps, I can make an animation or a sound play. 
            It's just another tool that is already being really helpful in making the first level more interactive and I will continue to improve on it.
